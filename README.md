MusicalSwitcher
===============

Musical switcher is a tweak for iOS devices on iOS 7 that turns the app switcher into a piano. Swiping down on each app snapshot produces a note that climbs the scale as you go further. For the first release, there is only one octave, but more options will be coming in future updates!
